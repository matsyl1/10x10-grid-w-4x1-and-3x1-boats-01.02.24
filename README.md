10x10 grid with two randomly placed non-intersecting 4x1 and 3x1 boats. 
Using adjacency and same axis tests to ensure boats placed within the grid. 
Non-intersection test to ensure coords of boats don't overlap. 
No user interaction (building up to fully functional/playable game)
Output is a 10x10 grid showing the position of the boats.
